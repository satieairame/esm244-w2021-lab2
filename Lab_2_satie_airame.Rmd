## Part 1: PCA with penguins

```{r}
penguin_pca <- penguins %>% 
  select(body_mass_g, ends_with("_mm")) %>% # To select several columns that all end with a particular string, e.g., _mm
  drop_na() %>% # To remove NA
  scale() %>% # To take the data and put in all on similar scales
  prcomp() # To create a PCA outcome

penguin_pca$rotation # Bring up loadings for each of the PCA, what are the loadings for the variable, e.g., rotation

# Type ?scale and ?autoplot in the Console to learn more about these functions

# Make a new dataset with the observations that exist, match the observations that were used to create this PCA biplot but still contain the other variables.

penguin_complete <- penguins %>% 
  drop_na(body_mass_g, ends_with("_mm")) # make new dataset from penguins that has the exact same observations used in the PCA but also has the other variables

autoplot(penguin_pca,
         data = penguin_complete,
         colour = "species", # use other dataset for the aesthetics 
         loadings = TRUE, # add loadings (arrows)
         loadings.label = TRUE) + # add labels for the loadings, can customize the location of labels so they don't overlap
  theme_minimal()
